## About me

![my image](./img/seal.png)![my face](./img/face.png)

I'm ICT architect living in Osaka, Japan.
I'm good at leaving new knowledge in the frontier.

My nickname is `sealddr`, since
I'm so obese that I look like seals,
and I'm eager to playing DDR (The dance simulation game published by
[Konami Digital Entertainment](https://www.konami.com/games/jp/ja/)).
My real name is `Masakazu Kadoshita`
