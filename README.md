## About me
I'm ICT architect living in Osaka, Japan.
My nickname is `sealddr`, since
I'm so obese that I look like seals, and I'm eager to playing DDR (The dance simulation game published by [Konami Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd.](https://www.konami.com/games/jp/ja/)).
My Real name is `Masakazu Kadoshita`
